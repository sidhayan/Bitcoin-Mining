# Bitcoin-Mining
# Simple Bitcoin Mining Script

This is a simple Python script for mining bitcoins using the SHA-256 algorithm. It demonstrates how cryptocurrency mining works at a basic level.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `bitcoin_mining.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `bitcoin_mining.py`.
4. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python bitcoin_mining.py
    ```

5. You can adjust the difficulty level of mining by changing the `difficulty` variable in the script. Higher difficulty values will result in longer mining times.
